Looks good, thanks.

- The separate timeouts (connect 4s, total 15s) are perfect for my use case, please keep them as-is.
- Good job adding the canonicalization test. Please make sure the canonicalization covers:
  - remove fragments (#...)
  - remove trailing slash (but keep "/" for the root)
  - remove tracking params: utm_*, fbclid, gclid
  - do NOT remove functional params like id/p/article/etc.

Next, please run a quick manual check:
1) Refresh a feed twice and confirm 304 does NOT clear the list.
2) Scroll the RSS list without pressing Enter and confirm no article/site fetch happens.
3) Press Enter on 3 items from the same host and confirm rate limiting/backoff shows in logs when needed.

If all good, we can consider this merged.
