You are working inside the Novapad codebase (Rust, Windows). The project already has a Podcast player and NVDA integration via NVDA Controller Client. Implement “Podcast Chapters” support with accessible announcements and navigation commands.

GOALS
1) Chapters parsing + model:
   - Support Podcasting 2.0 chapters first:
     - Parse <podcast:chapters ...> in the episode RSS item (namespace: https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0).
     - The tag provides a URL and a type. Support type "application/json+chapters" (JSON Chapters spec).
     - Fetch the chapters JSON over HTTP using the project’s existing HTTP client (do NOT add bypass techniques; normal fetching only).
   - Represent chapters as: Vec<Chapter> where Chapter = { start_ms: u64, title: String, url: Option<String>, image: Option<String> }.
   - Sort chapters by start_ms ascending, drop invalid entries (missing startTime or title, negative times, duplicates can be kept but stable).

2) Player integration:
   - The audio player already tracks current playback position in ms (or can query it). Add a “current chapter index” function:
     - Given current_pos_ms and chapters, return the index i of the last chapter whose start_ms <= current_pos_ms (or None if before first).
   - Add “seek_to_chapter(index)” that seeks player to chapters[index].start_ms.

3) NVDA announcement behavior (important):
   - When playback advances into a new chapter, NVDA must announce: "Chapter: {title}" exactly once per chapter transition.
   - Do NOT repeat the same chapter announcement continuously (e.g., on timer ticks). Implement debouncing:
     - Keep last_announced_chapter_index: Option<usize> in the playback/session state.
     - On position updates, compute current_chapter_index; if it differs from last_announced_chapter_index, announce and update last_announced_chapter_index.
   - Use the existing NVDA Controller Client wrapper (already in the repo). Use the same pattern used for other spoken status messages. Do not change already-working NVDA code; only extend it.

4) UI / Commands (menu “Riproduci”):
   Add three commands in the “Riproduci” menu and bind them consistently with existing command system:
   A) “Capitolo successivo”:
      - If there is a next chapter after current_chapter_index, seek to it.
      - If currently before the first chapter, go to chapter 0.
      - If already at last chapter, optionally announce “Ultimo capitolo” (or do nothing) – follow existing UX conventions in the codebase.
   B) “Capitolo precedente”:
      - If there is a previous chapter, seek to it.
      - If in first chapter, seek to 0:00 or the first chapter start based on existing behavior (choose consistent behavior).
   C) “Lista capitoli…”:
      - Opens a list UI consistent with other lists in Novapad (e.g., list of episodes, RSS items).
      - Populate rows with "mm:ss  Title" (or hh:mm:ss if long).
      - On Enter on a row: seek to that chapter start and close the list, then NVDA announces the chapter (either immediately or via chapter-change detection; ensure it’s announced once).

5) Caching & performance:
   - Cache chapters per episode GUID/URL in memory for the session to avoid refetching on every play.
   - If chapters fetch fails, playback still works; show/announce a non-blocking message like “Capitoli non disponibili”.

6) Files & structure:
   - Create or extend modules in a clean way:
     - e.g., podcast/chapters.rs for parsing + fetching + model
     - integrate into podcast/player.rs (or equivalent)
     - integrate commands/menu in the UI command registry.
   - Add minimal unit tests for:
     - JSON parsing of chapters with various startTime formats (number seconds, "HH:MM:SS" if spec allows; handle the formats you choose and document it).
     - current chapter index calculation edge cases (before first, exactly at boundary, after last).

DELIVERABLES
- Implement code changes with compile-clean result.
- Provide a short summary of what you changed and where.
