So here is a bit of a strange bug.
When Novapad is first launched and you use quotes, they’re normal straight quotes. Sometimes, though, they turn into smart quotes when you try to write something with quotes.
I have no idea why it does this. Maybe there needs to be a setting that lets you turn smart quotes on and off?
"This is a test."
As you can see, this time they came out as normal straight quotes. When I tried it earlier, they were smart quotes.
It's not something that happens regularly, so good luck trying to resolve this one lol.
